  <h4>Why an Habit Tracker ?</h4>
  <p>While I was initially going for a To-do List, I found out a video about Habits, this is where it started</p>
  <p>Searched for good PC habit trackers applications and couldn't find one that fited me.</p>
  <p>Also it was a bit challenging for me to do, and as I often say "no challenge = no fun".</p>
  <p>The original idea comes from James C.Clear, here is the link to <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">"Atomic Habits by James Clear"</a></p>
