  <h4>Step 3 : Habits</h4>
  <p>There are good habits and bad habits, one has to be picked.</p>
  <p>Bad habits are traited the opposite from good habits, in term of results.</p>
  <p>For example if you've burnt 15 cigarettes in one day, and checked all 15/20 of the 20 checkpoints you planned in the application.
   Then we will give you a 25% success, when it would have been 75% success for a good habit.</p>
